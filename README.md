# nftscii is a fork of Playscii. First and foremost, massive thanks to the dev(s) that built playscii. It is clear that a lot of work has gone into this software. The only reason this fork exists is because access to the open source code was cut off simply because the developer doesn't like that NFT artists are using the software for NFTs. So, here it is if you need it. The MIT License obviously allows for forks like this to be set up, so there's nothing wrong with doing this. The remainder of this readme is left in tact as the original developer had it. ~SquintDev
